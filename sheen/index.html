    <h3>Demo Content</h3>
        This page is a demo  that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.
        <br> <br>
        
We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.<br><br>
Obviously, we've styled up all the basic text formatting options available in markdown.<br><br>
You can create lists:
<ul class="ul-bullet">
    <li>Simple bulletted lists</li>
    <li>Like this one</li>
    <li>Are cool</li>

</ul>
<br>
And:<br>
<br>
<ol class="bullet"> 
<li>Numbered Lists</li>
<li>Like this one</li>
<li>Are great too</li>
</ol>
<br>
You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:
<br>
<blockquote>
    The longer I live, the more I realize that I am never wrong about anything, and that all the pains I have so humbly taken to verify my notions have only wasted my time!
</blockquote>

Here’s another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead. <br><br>
A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won’t scroll down to find it half way through your images.<br>

<h1> What about videos? </h1>
Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work<br>
 great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:
